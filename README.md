# Fast-point-tracking-system
Fast point tracking system will help the students at Fast to track the location of their points. 
The purpose of this project is to provide ease to the drivers and students.
Many students miss their point just because they do not know the exact arrival time. With our app, the user can also check the arrival time.
The administrator can also keep record of points' arrival time as well as track the point. 
The driver can notify the users if he will be late due to traffic jam or some other reason.
